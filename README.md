# Project Name:

ToyTopia – A Local Kids Toy Store Platform

# Purpose:

ToyTopia is your go-to online playground for everything that is related to toys! It’s a fun and friendly space where families can easily browse a wide variety of toys, shop by budget, and stay up to date with the latest trends. Whether you're looking for the perfect gift or just something new to spark your child’s imagination, ToyTopia makes the experience simple and enjoyable.
But it’s more than just shopping — you can apply to test exciting new toys, build your own Wishlist, and share your thoughts through reviews and ratings to help other parents make great choices. Plus, by shopping on ToyTopia, you're also supporting local toy sellers and helping keep playtime creative, meaningful, and community-driven.
The purpose is to make a website that is responsive, user-friendly and attractive to kids so that people can visit it using any device and can keep a track of the toys that they admire.
